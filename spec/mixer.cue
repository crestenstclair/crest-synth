// Mixer — channel strips, buses, and sends. Standard console architecture:
// strip (input gain → inserts → volume/pan → send taps) → bus → master.

project: contexts: Mixer: purpose: "mixing console: per-patch channel strips with insert FX and sends, aux buses with returns, and a master bus with a limiter"
