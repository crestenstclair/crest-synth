//! The meter transport: decimated latest-value push of
//! [`AudioObservationSnapshot`] frames to the page.
//!
//! The window's event loop feeds the channel the latest snapshot each tick —
//! read through the same `AudioObservationCallback` accessor the retired native
//! window paints its meters from — and the channel emits at most one frame
//! per [`METER_INTERVAL`] on the [`METER_EVENT`] named event. This realizes
//! DESIGN.md's meter transport semantics ("latest-value snapshots,
//! decimated") as equivalent push traffic: same decimation, same
//! loss-tolerance, no new state category.
//!
//! # Latest-value only — no queue
//!
//! The channel owns exactly one pending slot. Every observation overwrites
//! it; nothing is ever queued behind it, so queue depth is structurally
//! bounded at one frame regardless of how fast observations arrive
//! (crest-spec `requirement.serialized_projection_transport`: 30 Hz
//! "without queue growth over a five-minute render").
//!
//! # Loss semantics: display-only degradation
//!
//! A frame superseded before the next due emit is simply never sent, and a
//! frame whose emit fails is dropped — the next observation replaces it.
//! Meters are render evidence, not control state: a lost frame costs one
//! meter repaint and nothing else, and the next due frame carries the
//! current values (crest-spec `requirement.serialized_projection_transport`:
//! "their loss degrades display only"). Emit failures therefore never take
//! the window's fatal error path.
//!
//! # Nothing here touches the real-time callback
//!
//! The channel runs on the window's event thread and reads the control side's
//! copy of the last completed render block's evidence — the same
//! atomically-published snapshot the retired native window read every frame. It
//! installs nothing into the audio callback, allocates nothing inside it,
//! and shares no lock the callback could contend on; the render path's
//! measured bounds are unchanged from the pre-cutover shell baseline (crest-spec
//! `requirement.serialized_projection_transport`; measured in WP06).
