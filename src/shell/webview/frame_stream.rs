//! The qualifying-frame stream: the control-side seam that answers "has a
//! qualifying frame for this accepted identity been painted?" from recorded
//! evidence instead of from a sleep (mission webview-shell-cutover WP02,
//! T006).
//!
//! The window's painted-ack forwarding records every forwarded
//! [`ShellFrameObservation`] here, right where it also hands the observation
//! to the `AppWindow` port's frame callback. Control-side consumers hold a
//! [`QualifyingFrameStream`] handle cloned from
//! [`TauriWebviewWindow::frame_stream`] before the window runs and put that
//! question to it as a non-blocking [`poll`] from inside their tick loop.
//!
//! # What qualifies
//!
//! A recorded observation qualifies for a [`FrameExpectation`] when its
//! `generation` and `stateHash` equal the awaited accepted generation's and
//! its `context` and `activeSurface` equal the expectation's — the same
//! identity fields the retired live path's crediting started from
//! (`src/testing/live_demo_runner.rs`, `shell_frame_qualifies`). The stream
//! never fabricates or relaxes anything: it only replays observations the
//! forwarding actually constructed from painted acks.
//!
//! # No sleeps, bounded memory
//!
//! There is no polling loop and no sleep anywhere in this module: a poll
//! answers immediately from what the forwarding already recorded, and a
//! consumer that is not yet satisfied simply asks again on its next tick.
//! The stream retains only the most recent [`RECENT_OBSERVATION_CAPACITY`]
//! observations; an observation superseded past that window is display
//! evidence already consumed, and losing it degrades observation only.
//!
