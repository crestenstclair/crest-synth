//! The projection transport: generation-gated push of the accepted
//! projection's embedded semantic model to the page.
//!
//! On each tick where the fetched [`GraphicalShellProjection`] carries a new
//! accepted generation, the channel serializes the projection's embedded
//! [`SemanticGraphicalViewModel`] with `serde_json` and emits the document on
//! the [`PROJECTION_EVENT`] named event through the tauri `Emitter`. The
//! payload is exactly the projector's serialization — one schema, no
//! page-facing struct, no trimmed or selected field (crest-spec
//! `requirement.serialized_projection_transport`). If the page ever needs a
//! field this document lacks, the fix is in the projector via the crest-spec,
//! never a wrapper here.
//!
//! # Generation gating
//!
//! Emission is gated on the projection's accepted `generation`, not on deep
//! comparison: the projector already stamps every accepted document with its
//! generation and state hash, so an unchanged generation means an unchanged
//! document. A tick that fetches the same generation emits nothing — the
//! ~85 KB serialization happens only when a reducer edit actually produced a
//! new accepted document. The gate advances only on a successful emit; a
//! failed emit leaves the gate unmoved so the document is not silently lost
//! while the window still lives.
//!
//! # Emit failures are typed, surfaced, and tolerated at teardown
//!
//! An emit failure is a typed [`ProjectionChannelError`] the window converts
//! onto its declared `WindowError` path — the same record-first-error-and-
//! close-once treatment the retired native adapter gave an invalid late frame. It is
//! never a panic; during teardown the window stops pushing once the webview
//! is destroyed, so a shutdown race cannot turn a clean close into a fatal
//! error (see `window.rs`).
//!
//! # Painted acks come back and become observations (WP02 T005)
//!
//! After the page paints a pushed document it echoes the document's semantic
//! identity plus its measured post-paint geometry on the [`PAINTED_EVENT`]
//! event. [`ProjectionChannel::forward_ack`] receives that ack, correlates
//! it against the bounded in-flight tracker this channel fills on each
//! successful push, and constructs exactly one [`ShellFrameObservation`] —
//! identity copied verbatim (the ack must match the pushed document field
//! for field), viewport and region rectangles taken from the ack's measured
//! geometry. An ack that matches no in-flight pushed document never becomes
//! an observation: expected region names or a pre-render layout plan alone
//! cannot construct a passing observation (crest-spec
//! `valueObject.Shell.ShellFrameObservation`). Which of the two ways that
//! can happen decides the outcome: an ack claiming a generation newer than
//! anything ever pushed is fabricated evidence and stays a typed
//! [`PaintedAckError`], while a late ack for an already-superseded document
//! (dropped from the bounded tracker under sustained generation churn —
//! observed on the first webview-hosted live runs, mission
//! webview-shell-cutover WP03) is a lost frame consumed as
//! [`ForwardedAck::SupersededLate`], degrading observation only.
//!
//! A superseded document whose ack never arrives is dropped from tracking
//! when a successor acks (or when the bounded tracker is full) — lost frames
//! degrade observation only, exactly like the retired native adapter dropping an
//! unpainted frame.
//!
//! # The verbatim-copy rule holds in every window (FR-003)
//!
//! Being consumed as a lost frame is not being consumed unchecked. A dropped
//! document leaves its serialized identity behind in a second bounded window
//! ([`RETAINED_RETIRED_IDENTITIES`]), fed by both ways a document retires —
//! capacity eviction on push, and the drain of the acked document and every
//! older one on a successful ack. A late ack naming a generation still inside
//! that window is held to the same field-for-field comparison an in-flight ack
//! is, through the same single implementation, and a rewritten identity is the
//! same typed [`PaintedAckError::IdentityMismatch`] in either window. Only
//! once an ack outlives the retained window does the channel stop making a
//! claim: it holds nothing to compare against, so the ack stays a lost frame
//! rather than becoming a false rejection. What never changes is that a
//! superseded-late ack constructs no [`ShellFrameObservation`] at all,
//! validated or not.
//!
//! # Nothing here touches the real-time callback
//!
//! The channel runs on the window's event thread and reads only the immutable
//! control-side projection that the `ProjectionCallback` already hands every
//! `AppWindow` — the same value the retired native adapter painted. It installs
//! nothing into the audio callback, allocates nothing inside it, and shares
//! no lock the callback could contend on; the render path's measured bounds
//! are unchanged from the pre-cutover shell baseline (crest-spec
//! `requirement.serialized_projection_transport`; measured in WP06).
