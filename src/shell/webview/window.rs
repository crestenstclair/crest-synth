//! The Tauri v2 webview window — the product's one shell behind the
//! `AppWindow` port.
//!
//! Composition follows the WP01 input-capture probe verdict
//! (`kitty-specs/webview-shell-foundation-01KZ9DN7/research/input-capture-probe.md`):
//!
//! - keys are captured Rust-side by [`input_capture::install`] (NSEvent local
//!   monitor, installed on the main thread before the event loop starts) and
//!   normalized through the same [`KeyboardInputTranslator`] the retired native
//!   window uses — one shared key state machine, no page key handler;
//! - the event loop runs through `run_return`, never `run`, so
//!   `AppWindow::run` returns and `StandaloneApplication::run` performs the
//!   same owned shutdown the retired native close performed (stream release before
//!   worker completion, graph ownership collection, normal exit);
//! - the tao loop waits when idle, so a detached waker pings the main thread
//!   at the 16 ms idle-frame cadence the retired native path used and control-side
//!   ticks run on `MainEventsCleared`;
//! - `Focused(false)` feeds [`WindowInput::focus_lost`], clearing the held-K
//!   modifier exactly as the retired native adapter did;
//! - the page is served over the registered `crest://` custom protocol
//!   (`WebviewUrl::External` requires http(s) and data URLs are rejected at
//!   the config layer).
//!
//! The window serves the authored projection page (`webview-page/`) with its
//! generated token table, composition stylesheet, render script, and
//! vendored Azeret Mono faces, all embedded at compile time and routed by
//! request path through the `crest://` protocol handler under a restrictive
//! Content-Security-Policy ([`PAGE_CSP`]). Page resolution happens before
//! any window exists, so an unloadable page is a typed
//! [`WebviewShellError::PageLoadFailed`] and the process ends with no blank
//! window. The deterministic trigger for that path is the debug-build-only
//! `CREST_WEBVIEW_PAGE` override documented in [`crate::shell::webview`].
//!
//! Two page-reported conditions come back over IPC events and are handled
//! here (mission webview-shell-cutover WP02): each painted document's ack
//! (`crest://painted`) is forwarded through the projection channel into
//! exactly one `ShellFrameObservation` on the port's frame callback and the
//! qualifying-frame stream, and a thrown page render failure
//! (`crest://render-error`) is a typed
//! [`WebviewShellError::PageRenderFailed`] on the same fatal runtime path a
//! startup failure uses. A failed `window.close()` is retried once; a second
//! failure is recorded typed and ends the event loop directly, so the
//! shutdown path surfaces it — never swallowed, and never a loop left
//! waiting on a close that is not going to happen (mission shell-hygiene
//! RISK-3).
