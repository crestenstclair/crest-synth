//! The closed component state vocabulary.
//!
//! A component is handed exactly one [`ComponentState`] as immutable input. It
//! never derives, caches, or owns one.
//!
//! The set is closed and there is no catch-all variant, so adding a state makes
//! the compiler name every `match` that must change. Any `match` on
//! [`ComponentState`], anywhere, is exhaustive with no wildcard arm — a `_`
//! arm converts that compile error into a silent visual default, which is the
//! failure this type exists to prevent.
//!
//! Every state announces itself with text or shape and not with color alone
//! (`DESIGN.md:575`). That pairing is declared here as data, in
//! [`ComponentState::appearance`], rather than as branching inside each
//! primitive.
//!
//! Realizes `valueObject.Shell.ComponentState`.
