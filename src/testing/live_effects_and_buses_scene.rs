//! The retained `demo-live-effects-and-buses` scene.
//!
//! This is the phase-completion gate: the cumulative live scene inherits the
//! complete sixteen-track routing scene — scalar sweep, engine transitions,
//! semantic tail, and teardown contract — and appends the ordered topology
//! transitions that demonstrate the expandable-effects-and-bus-topology
//! behaviors through semantic actions and `AppState::apply` only: filling all
//! three slots of a Patch one at a time, exchanging two genuinely different
//! effects so the order change is audible, two instances of one registry
//! entry, sends raised toward several of the eight destinations, changing the
//! effect occupying a return, one controlled rejection with a visible reason
//! and uninterrupted audio, and a rerouted Patch whose chain follows it.
//!
//! The demonstration subject is the first installed Patch: the production
//! audio observation correlates the first stem (`primaryPatchId`) and the
//! first active effect chain (`patchEffect`), so its slot grid is the one
//! whose changes are measurable per block. Its startup chorus is cleared
//! first — while a held note rings — and the grid is restored to the startup
//! configuration before the frozen semantic tail, preserving the base
//! scene's structural-restoration teardown contract.
//!
//! Every slot and return occupancy change travels the player's on-screen
//! journey: focus visibly walks to the PATCH effect-slot row (or the MIXER
//! Inspector return row), the landing is verified against the canonical
//! projection, and occupancy cycles by the adjacent-choice Edit gesture —
//! the same nonwrapping contract as the engine row. A target that is not
//! adjacent to the current occupant is reached by cycling through the
//! intervening choices; each pass is its own audible transition, and the
//! retained identity always lands on the same resulting occupancy the scene
//! has always proven. The single exception is the controlled rejection,
//! which stays a direct injection because the UI cannot express an unknown
//! registry entry. One installed occupant's descriptor scalar is also edited
//! audibly from the PATCH page.
//!
//! Registry entries are always addressed positionally through the installed
//! registry — nothing in this scene names an effect.
