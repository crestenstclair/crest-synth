//! The structured result the functional Patch editor's live acceptance emits,
//! and the accumulator that measures it.
//!
//! Every field here is **measured** from the production reducer, the canonical
//! projection, the prepared renderer's audio observation, the painting page's
//! own acknowledgment, and the host's teardown — never copied from expected
//! data. Where a fact has one producer it is transported from that producer
//! rather than recomputed beside it: the PATCH strip's
//! group structure is decided by the page and carried in the paint ack, and
//! this observation copies what arrived.
//!
//! # Keying, and why it is the sharpest rule here
//!
//! Every "second Patch" counter is keyed by the PatchId resolved from the
//! **final state's installed order**, never from the scene's own subject. A
//! scene whose patch switch has been defeated still
//! visits three slots and still makes an audible edit — just on the wrong
//! instrument. A counter that counted the work without checking where it
//! landed would pass under defeat, which is exactly the shape of defect this
//! mission has spent its length finding.
//!
//! # Wire form
//!
//! Snake case, matching the acceptance schema and the shipped
//! `SixteenTrackMixerRoutingObservation` beside it.
