//! The browsable component gallery, re-hosted on the webview surface.
//!
//! One command opens a real webview window showing every declared component
//! specimen through the authored vocabulary. Digit keys `1`–`9` and `0` select
//! the first ten pages; `[` and `]` step through all fifteen. The active page
//! identity is on screen at all times.
//!
//! # How the re-host is shaped (WP04, spec C-006: rebuild, not retire)
//!
//! The scene keeps what it always owned — the page registry, the scene-local
//! digit and stepping bindings, the coverage assertions, and the post-paint
//! observation. What changed is the painting: instead of native paint passes,
//! the scene builds one [`GalleryDocument`] per page and pushes it to a
//! Tauri v2 webview over the [`GALLERY_DOCUMENT_EVENT`] channel, where
//! `webview-page/gallery.js` renders it from the same generated
//! `webview-page/tokens.css` token table the product page uses and
//! `webview-page/gallery.css` lays it out at both authored densities. The
//! push mechanics mirror `crate::shell::webview::projection_channel` (an
//! identity-gated emit through the tauri `Emitter`); the gallery deliberately
//! selects its own event names so the product's projection transport carries
//! production documents only.
//!
//! The gallery document is a **gallery-scene document**. It lives beside
//! `SemanticGraphicalViewModel`, makes no claim on the production projection
//! schema, and is never pushed on the production projection channel — the
//! byte-identity proof governs production documents, and this type is not one
//! (spec C-002/C-006).
//!
//! # This scene is browsable, not autonomous
//!
//! Every other `demo-live-*` scene is deliberately input-isolated: while
//! active, mapped semantic key input is not dispatched into `AppState`, so an
//! asynchronous edit cannot replace the exact generation a checkpoint awaits
//! (`DESIGN.md:634-644`). This scene is the opposite on purpose. It exists to
//! be driven by hand. It therefore accepts input, makes no exact-generation
//! claim, asserts nothing about audio, does not time out, and is not an alias
//! for `demo-live`.
//!
//! It does not weaken the witness contract because it never claims one. The
//! danger runs both ways: giving this scene the witness contract would break
//! paging, and copying this scene's input handling back into a witness would
//! break the generation correlation those scenes depend on. Do neither.
//!
//! # The hard invariant
//!
//! Page selection is scene-local. It never becomes a `SemanticAction`, never
//! reaches `AppState`, and never changes focus, Patch values, graph revision,
//! or audio behavior. The scene binds its digits itself and never consults
//! [`KeyboardInputTranslator`](crate::shell::keyboard_input_translator::KeyboardInputTranslator);
//! `Digit1` and `Digit2` select PATCH and MIXER in the application and select
//! pages here, which is safe precisely because the binding never leaves this
//! file. Keys are captured Rust-side by
//! [`crate::shell::webview::input_capture`] — the same native monitor the
//! product webview shell uses — and the page registers no key handler at all.
//! The scene holds one production `AppState` purely so the claim is
//! *measured*: its generation is read before the window opens and again after
//! it closes, and the difference is reported.
//!
//! # The observation is ack-gated
//!
//! Every count in [`ComponentGalleryObservation`] accumulates from
//! [`GalleryPaintedAck`] values the page emits on
//! [`GALLERY_PAINTED_EVENT`] *after* painting a document — the page reads its
//! own painted DOM back and copies the page, state, and viewport identity
//! actually rendered. A digit request alone proves only that a key was
//! pressed; the page it asked for counts as reached only when its painted ack
//! arrives. There is no constructor that accepts an expected page set, a
//! specimen list, or a coverage plan, so a pre-render plan cannot satisfy the
//! observation.
//!
//! Realizes `valueObject.Shell.ComponentGalleryPage` and
//! `valueObject.Shell.ComponentGalleryObservation` over
//! `requirement.browsable_component_gallery` and
//! `requirement.silent_component_gallery`.
