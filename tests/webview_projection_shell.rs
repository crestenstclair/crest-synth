//! Acceptance for the webview projection shell.
//!
//! Five falsifiable proofs over the production reducer, projector, transports,
//! generated token table, committed projection page, and the real shipped
//! binary:
//!
//! - T022 serialized-schema fidelity: the emit path's document is
//!   byte-identical to the projector's own serialization across distinct
//!   reducer states in BOTH top-level contexts — three MIXER states plus
//!   PATCH root, interaction, alternate-capability, maximum-content,
//!   lifecycle, Detail, and Browser states — so no page-facing schema fork
//!   can hide behind generation gating across either context.
//! - T023 token-table freshness: the committed `webview-page/tokens.css` is
//!   byte-fresh against the authored vocabulary via WP04's
//!   `committed_tokens_are_fresh` contract, carries the GENERATED header, and
//!   keeps the injective property-name transform; drift names its property.
//! - T024 page render determinism: the real page in a real Tauri window
//!   renders one document to the same declared observation twice at both
//!   representative viewports, with the declared MIXER anatomy — and (WP01) the
//!   same double-render determinism for the PATCH fixture documents, with
//!   the projected strip rows in declared order, the focused row carrying
//!   the declared focus treatment, and every painted acknowledgment
//!   carrying the exact semantic identity (generation, stateHash, context,
//!   active surface, focus path, interaction mode) of its document, one ack
//!   per painted document in paint order.
//! - T025 typed startup failure: an unloadable page is a typed
//!   `PageLoadFailed` on stderr with nonzero exit and no fallback shell,
//!   proven on the shipped binary as a subprocess.
//! - T026 shutdown parity and the live layer: the harness window closes
//!   through the owned CloseRequested → Destroyed → Exit path; the shipped
//!   binary reaches the identical owned shutdown (stream release before
//!   worker completion, graph ownership collection, exit 0) under BOTH
//!   shells from real window-close runs; NFR-001 (projection-to-paint p95
//!   ≤ 50 ms via the `crest://painted` ack) and NFR-002 (30 Hz meter cadence
//!   over a soak with a structurally bounded pending slot) are measured live.
//!
//! Mission webview-render-fidelity-hardening-01KZCEF8 WP03 adds three
//! sections and re-bases every live proof on the production security policy
//! (closing the cutover review's DRIFT-1):
//!
//! - T010 harness policy parity: the live window serves every asset through
//!   the exported production seam `crest_synth::shell::webview::
//!   protocol_response`, and a headless section asserts the served document's
//!   `Content-Security-Policy` header equals the exported `PAGE_CSP`
//!   constant — the single policy source, never a restated copy (research
//!   D3). The CSP text appears nowhere in this file as a literal.
//! - T011 painted-geometry fidelity: fixtures with known level/position
//!   values measure ACTUAL painted `.fader-fill` / `.prow-position-fill`
//!   geometry under the shipped policy, proportional to the document value,
//!   across representative viewports — and the inverse guard: any element
//!   carrying `data-level`/`data-position` without its CSSOM custom property
//!   applied (the RISK-1 signature) fails by name, distinguishing
//!   value-zero from variable-never-applied (research D4, FR-004).
//! - T012 forced render failure: a first-render throw on the shipped binary
//!   (page-override variant) ends the process nonzero through the typed
//!   `PageRenderFailed` path with exactly one typed payload; an
//!   update-render throw after a successful painted ack and an unhandled
//!   promise rejection each produce exactly one typed `crest://render-error`
//!   payload and no ack for the failing document; the healthy page emits
//!   zero render-errors across the whole suite (FR-006, spec US3 and the
//!   first-vs-update-render edge case).
//!
//! The shell-hygiene work adds two error-path proofs over the production path:
//!
//! - T013 forced double-close failure (live): with WP01's debug-only
//!   `CREST_WEBVIEW_FORCE_CLOSE_FAILURE` seam armed on the shipped binary so
//!   no close can succeed, the event loop still ends and the typed
//!   `WindowClose` reaches the operator carrying the forced cause verbatim
//!   (FR-001, FR-002). The run is bounded, so the pre-WP01 behavior — a
//!   correctly recorded fatal error the loop then waits forever to surface —
//!   fails as a named timeout instead of an ambiguous stall. The
//!   already-latched-`PageRenderFailed` arm is deliberately *not* asserted
//!   here: it is byte-for-byte indistinguishable with the seam disarmed, so
//!   it cannot fail; see the section's own notes.
//! - T014 superseded-late ack identity (headless): a late ack naming an
//!   already-retired generation answers to the same verbatim-copy rule as an
//!   in-flight one, through BOTH ways a document retires (capacity eviction
//!   and ack-consumption drain); a faithful late ack is still consumed as a
//!   lost frame, and past the bounded retained window even a rewritten
//!   identity stays a lost frame rather than a false rejection (FR-003).
//! - T015 (live): every real painted ack the healthy live sections produce is
//!   fed back through the production `ProjectionChannel::forward_ack` that
//!   pushed it, and zero are rejected — the negative control that FR-003's
//!   validation did not start rejecting honest evidence (NFR-001). Asserted
//!   last, beside the render-error control it mirrors.
//!
//! # Harness shape (`harness = false`)
//!
//! T024/T026 open a real Tauri window, which macOS only permits on the main
//! thread; the default libtest harness runs every test on a worker thread, so
//! this target declares `harness = false` in `Cargo.toml` and sequences its
//! sections from `main`. A failing section panics (nonzero exit) before the
//! acceptance marker can print.
//!
//! # Live gate — the env var and nothing else
//!
//! `CREST_WEBVIEW_TESTS=1` admits the two window-bearing sections. The
//! decision is taken once, before any window attempt, from the environment
//! variable alone; a failure inside a running live section is a failure,
//! never a skip. Headless runs print an explicit skip listing and the marker
//! carries it. `CREST_WEBVIEW_FULL_SOAK=1` lengthens the NFR-002 soak from
//! 60 s to 300 s (both configurations are printed).

/// swallowed.
///
/// One run on the shipped binary, with WP01's debug-only forced-close seam
/// armed so no close can succeed and the event loop can only end through the
/// exhausted-retry exit edge: the `--demo-live-graphical-shell` scene runs to
/// completion and closes through the ordinary end-of-scene path with a clean
/// first-error slot, so the `WindowClose` itself is what the operator sees,
/// verbatim, carrying the forced cause. That verbatim cause is this
/// section's proof that the seam really armed and that BOTH attempts failed:
/// the typed error does not exist until the retry is exhausted.
///
/// # The run this section used to open with, and why it is gone
///
/// A first run drove a page whose first render throws — so a
/// `PageRenderFailed` is already latched when the forced close fails — and
/// asserted US1 scenario 1 end to end. The shell-hygiene post-merge review
/// (RISK-2) found it vacuous, and the measurement is unambiguous: run the
/// shipped binary on that variant with the seam armed and with it disarmed
/// and the two transcripts are byte-identical — same exit code 1, same typed
/// `PageRenderFailed` payload, no `WindowClose` on stderr either way.
///
/// That is not an oversight to patch around, it is FR-002 working as
/// specified: a `WindowClose` recorded second loses the latch and never
/// reaches the operator, so "no `WindowClose` on stderr" is equally true when
/// no close ever failed. Every assertion in that run held with the mechanism
/// it named switched off, while its PASS line announced "with every close
/// forced to fail" — a claim it never checked. It read as coverage of
/// scenario 1 without constraining it, so it was removed rather than left
/// standing as a proof that cannot fail.
///
/// Scenario 1 keeps the coverage that *can* fail:
///
/// - the exhausted-retry decision and the first-error-wins latch, with a real
///   `WindowClose` recorded second, are proven in-module by
///   `window.rs::a_recorded_render_failure_still_wins_over_a_later_close_failure`
///   — invert the latch and it dies;
/// - the exit edge that ends the loop lives in the single
///   `close_window_once_with_retry` helper every arm closes through, and the
///   run below exercises it end to end on the shipped binary;
/// - the end-to-end surfacing of a typed `PageRenderFailed` from the shipped
///   binary is [`prove_forced_render_throw_on_the_shipped_binary`] (T012),
///   which is what the removed run was in fact re-proving.
///
/// Falsifiability: with WP01's `handle.exit(...)` removed the run below
/// cannot end — the window is still open and nothing else will stop the loop
/// — and it fails here as a named timeout rather than a silent stall. A
/// rename of the product's seam constant is caught the same way round: an
/// unarmed seam lets the scene close cleanly and exit 0, and the nonzero
