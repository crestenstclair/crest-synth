//! Deterministic acceptance for the functional Patch editor live scene's
//! **plan**: what it declares, where its work lands, and that its declared
//! controlled negative fails on reach rather than on its own scaffold.
//!
//! The live run itself needs a real window, a physical audio device, and a
//! display seating 1920×1080. Everything below is the half of that run which
//! is decidable without any of them: the plan is frozen from the production
//! fixture's own installed state, and every claim here is checked by
//! dispatching the plan's own events through the production `AppLoop` and
//! reducer — never by reading the plan back as its own confirmation.
